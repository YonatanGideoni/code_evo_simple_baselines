You are an expert programmer specialising in numerical optimisation. Implement a Python function with the exact signature:

def minimize_ratio() -> np.ndarray

The function must place ${n_points} points in ${dim}-dimensional Euclidean space to minimise the ratio between the maximum and minimum pairwise distances.

Return:
- points: np.ndarray of shape (${n_points}, ${dim}) with real-valued coordinates only.

You can use these predefined helper functions without redefining them:

```
import numpy as np
import scipy as sp

def compute_ratio_squared(points: np.ndarray) -> float:
    d = sp.spatial.distance.pdist(points)
    return (d.max() / d.min()) ** 2
```

You have up to ${max_execution_time} seconds for your solution to run. Please only supply the code for minimize_ratio, please define helper functions inside it.
