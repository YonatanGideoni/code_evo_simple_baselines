You are an expert machine learning engineer tasked with designing a new agentic system capable of solving complicated math problems coming from the AIME competition.

You will be given a program that implements an agent scaffold called `Agent`. Per problem processed in the `forward` function, the agent has a maximum number of 10 LLM queries. Your goal is to improve the agentic system by suggesting new scaffolds.

Some potential directions to explore include:
1. Chain-of-thought prompting
2. Multi-step reasoning and reflection
3. Temperature sampling and ensembling of answers (e.g. 0.0, 0.5, 1.0)
4. Few-shot example construction
5. Different expert prompts (e.g. "You are a skilled mathematician.")
6. Tree search methods (e.g. beam search, tree of thoughts)
7. Self-verification (e.g. different verifiers scoring solutions)

It is well known that reasoning models perform especially well on math problems like AIME. Explore different approaches to elicit deep thinking in simple LLM models.

Your goal is to maximize the average accuracy of the agent scaffold on the full AIME problem set.

The initial Agent class is:
```
from typing import Callable


class Agent:
    def __init__(
        self,
        query_llm: Callable,
        temperature=0.0,
    ):
        self.output_format_instructions = "On the final line output only the digits of the answer (0‑999). Provide your final answer enclosed in a LaTeX \\boxed{{...}} command."
        self.query_llm = query_llm
        self.temperature = temperature

    def forward(self, problem: str) -> tuple[str, float]:
        """Queries the LLM with a math problem."""
        system_prompt, task_prompt = self.get_prompt_for_task(problem)
        response, cost = self.query_llm(
            prompt=task_prompt,
            system=system_prompt,
            temperature=self.temperature,
        )
        return response, cost

    def get_prompt_for_task(self, problem: str) -> tuple[str, str]:
        system_prompt = "You are a skilled mathematician."
        task_prompt = f"{self.output_format_instructions}:\n\n{problem}\n\n"
        return system_prompt, task_prompt
```
Write a new `Agent` class that maximizes the accuracy on AIME. This class will be evaluated using this function:
```
def run_experiment(**kwargs):
    from utils import query_llm, create_call_limited_query_llm
    from functools import partial

    # Create base query_llm function
    base_query_llm = partial(query_llm, model_name=kwargs["model_name"])

    # Wrap it with call limiting (max 10 calls per forward pass)
    limited_query_llm = create_call_limited_query_llm(
        base_query_llm,
        max_calls=kwargs["max_calls"],
    )

    accuracy, cost_total, processed, num_llm_calls, df = agent_evaluation(
        Agent, limited_query_llm, year=kwargs["year"]
    )
    return accuracy, cost_total, processed, num_llm_calls, df
```

Make sure the final returned string is still in the AIME \boxed{...} format. It is crucial that the solution format of AIME is preserved. The solution should be a three-digit number (0-999) with no punctuation.
Be creative and think outside the box.
